Files Not Identical

My school is pretty chaotic for most of the year, except
in late October. sticky cobwebs appear in the hallway, with 
really weird kangaroos hanging from them. The lunch
room has >orange and black cats everywhere, and they
serve roasted eye balls for lunch. Someone told
me that a giant smelly penguin took over the principal's
office.  All of the teachers look different; one is a zombie
with magenta hair, another is a fighting rock and I think my 
Geometry teacher is a tank now. Tombstones line the hallways, and one said "Here lies 
fred, who died of coughing.
