class FileReading

	Fields:
		String outputPath = output.txt;
		String replacementWords;
		ArrayList<String> wordReplaceList = new ArrayList<String>;
		boolean hasReplaceList;
		
	Methods:
		bracesBalanced(String f1)
			int openBraces = 0;
			int closeBraces = 0;
		
			tries to open f1 if possible
				if not, prints Part 1: Unable to Open file in output.txt
			while f1 has another string
				read it
				if an openbrace
					openBrace++
				if closeBrace
					closeBrace++
			
			prints Braces balanced in output.txt if closeBraces = openBraces
			prints Braces not balanced in output.txt if closeBraces != openBraces
			
		identicalFiles(String f1, f2)
			Tries to open both f1 and f2 if possible
				if not, prints Part 2: Unable to open file in output.txt
			
			while both f1 and f2 have another string and those strings are equivalent
				it continues reading the strings
			
			if either file still has more text
				add Files not identical to output.txt
			
			otherwise,
				add Files Identical
				
		shortStory(f3)
			tries to open f3 if possible
				if not, prints Part 3: Unable to open file in output.txt
				
			if there is no replaceList and the next word starts with < and ends with >
				prompts the user for a word then adds it to the arraylist wordReplaceList
			
			reads through the file again
				if it isn't the end of a line, prints the word from the stream
				if it has a < or >, then that word is replaced with the nth term in wordReplaceList, n being however many such words have been found
				if it is the end of a line, inserts a new line into output.txt
				
		main
			asks for three files, f1, f2, and f3
		 	asks for a file with replacement words that will replace the story words
		 		if no words, the user will be prompted
